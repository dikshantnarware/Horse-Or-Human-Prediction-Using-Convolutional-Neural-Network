**This project involves training a (CNN) to accurately classify images as either containing a horse or a human, utilizing a labeled dataset,     preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. The trained model enables accurate predictions on new images.
The project "Horse or Human Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network" involves training a machine learning model to classify images as either containing a horse or a human using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here is a summary of the key steps involved:**

**1.Dataset Collection:** Gather a labeled dataset of images containing horses and humans.

2.**Data Preprocessing:** Resize the images to a consistent size and normalize the pixel values.

**3.Dataset Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

**4.Model Architecture:** Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification, such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception, or create a custom architecture.

**5.Training**: Train the CNN using the training set, utilizing techniques like forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD or Adam).

**6.Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to improve the model's performance, using the validation set for assessment.

**7.Evaluation:** Assess the trained model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**8.Predictions:** Use the trained model to predict whether new, unseen images contain a horse or a human by preprocessing the images and obtaining the predicted class based on the highest probability.

It's important to have a diverse and sizable dataset, as well as access to computational resources for training the model. Data augmentation techniques and staying updated with the latest advancements in the field can further enhance the model's performance.
